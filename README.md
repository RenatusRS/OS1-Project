# Multithreaded Kernel with Fork implementation

> Project for **Operating System 1** class at **UoB ETF** in the **2020/2021** school year

Simple kernel written in C++ for 8086 CPU.

Supports creation and forking of time sharing threads, semaphores and interrupt driven events.

It has to be compiled with **Borland C++ compiler**. After compiling you can run an example of an user program from the test folder.

Command line arguments for the example user program are `buffer size`, `number of producer threads` and `time slice`.
